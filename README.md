# traceLists on github

TraceLists are a matlab format for manipulating time series data, written
primarily for earthquake seismogram data. If you're new to this field I suggest
you turn around and use obspy instead (https://github.com/obspy/obspy/wiki),
it's an amazing and powerful resource and the method of choice for most
purposes. If you are determined to use matlab, on the other hand, you're in the 
right place. TraceLists provide a way to manipulate large amounts of seismic data 
in a systematic and easy way. They make it much easier to keep track of all the 
data and meta-information that comes with each record. 

This repository contains a tutorial that shows how to use traceLists and 
let's you experiments with some of the main features and functions of the 
traceList format. It's quite simple.

 I hope you enjoy the tutorial (\\_/) For comments and questions please email
